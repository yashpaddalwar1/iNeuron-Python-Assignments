    "# Q1. What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "getattribute: Is used to retrieve an attribute from an instance. It captures every attempt to access an instance attribute by using dot notation or getattr() built-in function. getattr: Is executed as the last resource when attribute is not found in an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "The Cliff's Notes version: descriptors are a low-level mechanism that lets you hook into an object's attributes being accessed. Properties are a high-level application of this; that is, properties are implemented using descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as properties and descriptors?\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "__getattribute__ has a default implementation, but __getattr__ does not. This has a clear meaning: since __getattribute__ has a default implementation, while __getattr__ not, clearly python encourages users to implement __getattr__ .\n"
