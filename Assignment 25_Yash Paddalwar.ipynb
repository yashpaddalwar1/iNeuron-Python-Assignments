    "## 1) . What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "Solution: The difference between the two kinds of expressions is that the List comprehension is enclosed in square brackets [] while the Generator expression is enclosed in plain parentheses ()\n",
    "## 2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
    "Solution: Every generator is an iterator, but not vice versa. A generator is built by calling a function that has one or more yield expressions ( yield statements, in Python 2.5 and earlier), and is an object that meets the previous paragraph's definition of an iterator .\n",
    "## 3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "Solution: A generator-function is defined like a normal function, but whenever it needs to generate a value, it does so with the yield keyword rather than return. If the body of a def contains yield, the function automatically becomes a generator function.\n",
    "## 4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "Solution: An yield statement looks much like a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead provides a value to the code looping over the generator and pauses execution of the generator function.\n",
    "## 5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "Solution: List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compared to map. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as map only returns a map object and does not return any list. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required)."
